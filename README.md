# Velo

Velo is a lightweight, self-hostable deployment and operations platform built on top of Docker Swarm. It's designed for small teams, homelab users, and edge deployments who want PaaS-like simplicity without the complexity of full Kubernetes managed services.

## Features

- **Multi-Interface Deployment**: Deploy services via CLI, Web UI, or chatbot integration
- **Security-First**: Built-in configuration and secret management with automated certificate provisioning
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive observability with logging, metrics, and alerting capabilities
- **Extensible**: Pluggable architecture supporting custom hooks and CI/CD integration

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jasonlovesdoggo/velo.git
   cd velo
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   go build -o bin/velo-manager ./cmd/manager
   go build -o bin/velo-client ./cmd/client
   ```

### Running the Server

- **Management Node**: Manages logging, backups, and configuration
- **Container Hosts**: Runs services with integrated metrics collection
